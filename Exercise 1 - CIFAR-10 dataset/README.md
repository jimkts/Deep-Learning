# Exercise 1 - CIFAR-10

In this assignment was built a deep classification network, optimised for the dataset <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html'>CIFAR-10</a>.

In optimising the network, we address the following aspects:
  1. Data pre-processing
  2. Depth and width of your network
  3. Choice of activation and loss functions
  4. Regularisation
  5. Choice of learning optimisers
  6. Hyper-parameters, such as batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc., depending on the chosen
configuration.
